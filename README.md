This is an attempt to solve my issue of always having to extract and keep track of all the torrent downloads.

## Requirements

#### Python Requirements.txt:

    ```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```

#### UNRAR:

1. This Requires the command line version of unrar to be installed.
2. Download the source here, http://www.rarlab.com/rar/unrarsrc-5.2.7.tar.gz
3. Extract the .tar.gz
3. In the Terminal:
   * ```$ cd ~/Downloads/unrar``` or Directory extracted to.
   * ```$ sudo make lib```
   * ```$ sudo make install-lib```
